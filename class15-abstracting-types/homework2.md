# Homework 15 - Abstracting Lists (via generics)

Create an Eclipse project named `hw15-lists-generics`. Copy in the lecture code from Monday, October 23rd:

- [lecture code](./code/generics)

## Tasks

- Finish up the two commented-out test cases at the bottom:

```
		assertEquals( 130, allrunners.totalOf(  ????  ));
		assertEquals( 7, names.totalOf( ????  ));   // total length of all strings
```

(Hint: You will need to define additional classes implementing `NumberFunction`, specialized to the appropriate type. You should not have any object casts in your code.)
