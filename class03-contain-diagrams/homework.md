# Homework 3 - Containment; Object Diagrams


Create classes that capture *bank customers* and *bank accounts*. A customer has a first and last name. An account has a customer and a balance. In addition to other examples, make objects for two accounts held by the same customer.

In the `BankCustomer` class, write a method `openAccount` that takes an initial deposit and returns a new bank account that has the initial deposit as the amount and the customer object as the customer.

In the `BankAccount` class, write a method `statusMessage` that takes no arguments and returns a string. The string should be one of `”Positive Balance”`, `”No Money”`, or `”Overdrawn”`, depending on whether the balance is positive, zero, or negative (respectively).
