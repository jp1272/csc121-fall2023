# Homework 20 - Array and String Loops Practice

## CodingBat

Every big programming problem has a lot of little programming problems in it. The little programming problems have elements we see again and again -- string and list manipulation, loops, a little logic.

CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build skill and and practice little code problems. The number of problems in each area is pretty large, so you can repeat and solidify your code skill in that area.

**Warning:** There are solutions to the CodingBat exercises all over the Internet. For your own sake, you should work on the problems on your own and not look at solutions. By looking at a solution, you get a false sense of understanding and feeling that you know how to write the code. From my experience, students who take shortcuts like this end up only cheating themselves, and their lack of competence becomes evident in their future work. Please don't deprive yourself of a learning experience. If you are stuck, post on Discord and I will provide appropriate hints and/or a video with suggestions.
