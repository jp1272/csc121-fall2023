## Course Description

(3-0-3) An introduction to the object-oriented model of programming, building on the design methodology introduced in CSC120. Students will design, implement, test, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes. Topics include classes, objects, inheritance, exceptions, interfaces, design by contract, basic design patterns, and software reuse. PR: CSC120.


## Textbooks

- M. Felleisen, M. Flatt, R.B. Findler, K.E. Gray, S. Krishnamurthy, V.K. Proulx, *[How to Design Classes](https://felleisen.org/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf)*. 
    (Reading to follow along with lecture topics, first 7 weeks.)

- [Java Precisely, Third Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529075/java-precisely/) 
    (A concise reference for the Java programming language. Material will be quizzed on.)


## Technology

- Canvas course site: http://cs.berry.edu/csc121. 
    > It is your responsibility to check the web site for this course regularly (i.e. daily) throughout the semester, as it will be regularly updated with announcements, lecture notes, source code, assignments, etc.

## Purpose of the Course

Picking up from CSC120, the purpose of this course is to introduce you to an object-oriented model of programming and computation. The goal is to help you understand the principles of class-based program design using an object-oriented programming language(s) - *i.e.* the goal is not Java itself. We use Java so you can see how the principles we learn are used in practical application. With emphasis on the design process, the course studies class-based program design and the design of abstractions that support reusable software and libraries.


## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you should be able to:
- Understand how to design programs using the object-oriented paradigm
- Demonstrate the ability to implement these designs
- Produce well-documented implementations
- Gain exposure to state-of-the-art development tools
- Use critical thinking skills and creativity to solve problems


## Assessment Measures

The determination of how well a student meets the learning outcomes above will be assessed by their overall grade in the course, based on performance on assignments and exams, as detailed below (see 'Evaluation Components'). A satisfactory level of competency will be demonstrated by earning a grade of 75% (C) or higher in the course.


## Evaluation Components and Grading Scale
Your grade will be computed based on a weighted average of the following course requirements:

- **10% Class attendance/participation**
    > Attendance in class is essential. Our meetings will consist of a mixture of lecture, discussion, and programming. You will be expected to read assigned material prior to the class session and to participate actively in class.
- **50% Programming assignments**
    > Assignments will be given on a daily basis. These assignments will involve applying techniques learned in class and will often involve extending or modifying code originally developed in a lecture session.
- **10% Semester project**
    > You will work in groups of 2 or 3 people on a project throughout the semester. Details of the project will be provided as the course progresses. It will involve the design and development of a computer game or graphical simulation chosen by each group.
- **10% Quizzes**
    > Online quizzes will be posted approximately every other week. They will cover material from lecture as well as reading material from the *Java Precisely* reference book.
- **20% Exams**
    > There will be a midterm (tentatively, Friday, October 6th) and a final exam (Wednesday, December 6th, 8-10am)


## Pair Programming

You may work with a partner for the labs and programming assignments if you like. (The written homework exercises should be completed individually.) If you do, you should engage in the pair programming model, that is both of you should be sitting at a single machine, side by side. One of you is "driving," at the keyboard and mouse programming. The other is actively engaged "navigating" - following along, catching mistakes, and providing ideas. You should make sure that over the course of an assignment that you spend roughly the same amount of time each "driving" and "navigating". Similarly, during labs, you should trade roles regularly.

Note: the following are not pair programming practices and are not acceptable ways of working with a partner for this course.

- Splitting the work in half, where each person does part of the work.
- Working individually at separate times.
- One person doing all of the work, but turning it in with both partner's names.

These will most likely reflect in poor exam grades since one or both partners will not be as familiar with the entire material as they should be.

**Important note 1:** A "pair" is two people. You are *not* allowed to work with more than one other person on programming assignments. Any assignment you turn in with more than 2 names on it will be returned with a zero (0) grade.

**Important note 2:** DO NOT share your (pair's) code with others. If you start working on homework exercises with one partner, do not switch halfway through to another partner, and share the code that you already completed.


## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to have read carefully and understood the rules governing breaches of academic integrity that are to be found in the Viking Code and the Course Catalog. Incidents of cheating will be dealt with as detailed in the Viking Code and Course Catalog.

For this course, you are allowed work in pairs as described above if you wish to do so. Other than this collaboration, any work that you submit must be entirely your own. **Do not copy or use other students' submission or any other existing code (including code on the Internet).** Copying programs and code from other sources and trying to just make minor changes therein will be detected and can result in severe penalties, up to and including **an F in the course**. You are always welcome to consult me for assistance - in person, by email, phone, etc. - if you are stuck.

As a general rule, if you do not understand what you are handing in, something is probably wrong. If you have given somebody some code simply so that it can be used in that person's assignment, you are probably cheating. Please don't do it.

**The use of Internet q&a sites or generative AI tools to complete assignments is prohibited for this course.** These have the potential to be useful for experienced developers and/or niche tasks. However, just as [baby walkers can actually impede](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-infant-walkers-safe/#:~:text=Walkers%20don%E2%80%99t%20always%20help%20children%20walk%20either) a child's motor development, relying on such tools will impede and prolong the process of ypur learning the material that this course covers. If anyone is found to be using ChatGPT or similar tools to generate code for this course, without express permission or direction to do so, they will be withdrawn administratively from the course.


## Attendance Policy

Please see the Berry College Viking Code for "Class Attendance Policies". Missing three (3) or more classes without justifiable reason (and appropriate documentation) will be considered excessive absences and an alert form will be sent to the proper authorities.

Sign-in sheets will be circulated and attendance records will be kept from the sign-in sheet. If your name is not readable on the list, you will be marked absent. Signing for someone else will be considered a serious breach of academic integrity. Similarly, endeavoring or engaging in any method to sign your name, or have your name signed, when you are absent will be treated as a breach of academic integrity.


## Late Work

**Late work will not be accepted** unless an excuse is obtained prior to the day on which the assignment is due. This policy will be waived only in an "emergency situation" with appropriate documentation and/or prior arrangement with the instructor.

Note: "I couldn't get the computer to work" or "My email/internet was not working", etc. are not acceptable excuses for late work (in general -- if the Berry network experiences major downtime I will adjust deadlines). If you start working on assignments early, instead of at the last minute, you will have time to ask me about any technical difficulties you are having. If for some reason you cannot upload assignments to the course website, attach them in an email and send directly to me by the deadline.


## Accommodation Statement

The Academic Success Center provides accessibility resources, including academic accommodations, to students with diagnosed differences and/or disabilities. If you need accommodations for this or other classes, please visit http://berry.edu/asc for information and resources. You may also reach out at 706-233-4080. Please note, faculty are not required, as part of any temporary or long-term accommodation, to distribute recordings of class sessions.


## Electronic Devices

Please don't use cell phones, pagers, etc. in class. Do not use computers for other than course activities during class time. Texting, instant messaging, Facebook, Twitter, emailing, and similar activities during class are inappropriate and distracting to everyone.


## Schedule of Class Sessions

A detailed schedule for the semester (subject to change) will be [maintained separately](schedule.md).
