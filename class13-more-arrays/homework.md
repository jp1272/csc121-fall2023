# Homework 13 - More Arrays

Create an Eclipse project named `hw13-more-arrays`.

## Part 1

Copy the live code from lecture here into your project:
- [Lecture code files](./live/)

1. Complete the `getLow()` and `getAverage()` methods. For your own benefit, try to write these from scratch, without looking at the `getHigh()` method.

2. Make the code in both `SeqDailyRecord` and `BasicDailyRecord` as "bulletproof" as possible. Write additional test cases of your own in a separate test method of the `DailyRecordTest` class that fail for the `BasicDailyRecord` as it currently stands.

You may assume that the coldest possible valid temperature value is -460 (absolute zero, Fahrenheit), and, reasonably speaking, the warmest possible valid temperature value is 1000 (warmest temperature on Mercury is 800 degrees Fahrenheit).
